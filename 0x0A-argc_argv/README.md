argc and argv are arguments that are sometimes passed into the main program from the command line when the
program executable is run.
argc is the argument counter that represents the number of arguments passed
argv is the argument vector, an array of strings containg the arguments
argc is passed as an integer
argv is passed as a pointer to an array of integers (char *argv[])
